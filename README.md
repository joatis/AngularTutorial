## Creating the Heroes Editor
* Create a new comonent using $ ng new component <componentName>
* This will create a new component, css and template for the component.
* However you still have to create a class for the model to refer to.
* When you need 2-way binding be aware that the FormsModule is not enabled
by default. You need to import the Forms Module into the app.module.ts and 
add it to the NgModules array.
* When you create components using the CLI it automatically adds it to the APP shell for you.
